# contacts

A new Flutter project to save contacts on your local device.

## Task

I have to create an app like Contact list.

**Functionality :**
- CRUD operations on it.
- Search bar for the search contact via name or mobile number
- Sort list based on Ascending and Descending manner.
- Filter a contact data based on the range of birthdate.

**Notes :**
- Initially there is no contact in the list.
- Section will automatically create when you are adding new contact.
- have to store those list in your local DB.
- For design, you can take idea from your devices contact model.
